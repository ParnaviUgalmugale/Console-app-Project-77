    <h1> Project on console</h1>
    <h2>What is visual studio code and how to use it ?</h2>
    <p> Visual studio code is a coding app where we can create console and javascripts. It has more efficient features than other apps and is easy to use.
     Once Visual studio code is downloaded, we must install the live server using extensions, which helps in seeing the outputs of our code. Next, we
    must go to explorer, where we should create html, css and js files where we are supposed to code. once code is done, we can click on go live on the bottom right corner and see the output.
coding on this app is really easy. Once you code more than 3 times, you'll get used to the app. </p>

<h3>How to open the console screen ?</h3>
<p> Right click on any page or website. Click on inspect. Once another pop up appears, go to console on the top beside elements.
    This is how you can open the console to any screen. </p>
        
    var first_name = "Ranbir";
    console.log(first_name);
    
    var last_name = "Kapoor";
    console.log(last_name);
    
    var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
    console.log(full_name);

    var a = 10;
    var b = 5;

    var add = a + b;
    console.log(add);

    var multiply = a * b;
    console.log(multiply);

    var subtract = a - b;
    console.log(subtract);

    var divide = a / b;
    console.log(divide);
